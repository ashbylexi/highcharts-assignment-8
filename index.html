  <h1>US Economy Measures</h1>

  <h2>By Alexis Ashby</h2>

    <p>The below graphs show the state of the US economy during specific time periods using different data measures. The first graph shows industry data in different categories over a time period of five years (1993 to 1997). This data can be used to see the fluctuation of GDP throughout the years listed. The second graph shows the value added by different industries over the same time period. Value added is a calculation of the toal value added at all stages of production, which is then calculated towards the total GDP. This measure allows people to see a breakdown of industry rather than the entire industry as a whole.
